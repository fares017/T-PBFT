\hypertarget{index_howto}{}\doxysection{How to use this code and what it is}\label{index_howto}
This code is intended to be some skeleton code to simplify the implementation of stateful B\+FT protocols. This project handles the message exchange via the \href{https://github.com/Determinant/salticidae}{\texttt{ salticidae}} library in an asynchronous way.

We define a \mbox{\hyperlink{classNode}{Node}} class that can be seen as a replica in a replicated scenario and member variables can be defined and updated to represent the state of a given instance. Messages that are received will enter a callback linked to that message from a specific \mbox{\hyperlink{classNode}{Node}} instance.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classHandler}{Handler}} creates the defined number of replicas and connects the nodes together in a fully connected network.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{messages_8h}{messages.\+h}} file defines the messages and the \mbox{\hyperlink{messages_8cpp}{messages.\+cpp}} file implements the serialization and de-\/serialization of the messages that are sent over the network as part of the protocol that is implemented on top.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{config_8h}{config.\+h}} file defines some configuration variables that are used throughout the project, for example the number of replicas that should be used.

Since this code is not a library per-\/se, it should not be imported but instead be modified and built-\/upon to implement a certain protocol. For a basic protocol implementation only the \mbox{\hyperlink{messages_8h}{messages.\+h}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{messages_8cpp}{messages.\+cpp}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{node_8h}{node.\+h}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{node_8cpp}{node.\+cpp}} files should need to be updated.

There is an accompanying client code that can be used for testing purposes. Its documentation is not as detailed as this code\textquotesingle{}s since it follows many of the same paradigms, just that it is only a single client trying to connect.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
\hypertarget{index_dependencies}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies}\label{index_dependencies}
The skeleton code needs the following Linux (Debian/\+Ubuntu) packages installed\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item build-\/essential
\item cmake
\item libuv1-\/dev
\item libssl-\/dev
\end{DoxyItemize}

The code was made under W\+S\+L2 with Ubuntu 22.\+04.\+2 L\+TS but should also run natively on Ubuntu and related Distros.\hypertarget{index_oneliner}{}\doxysubsubsection{One line to install everything}\label{index_oneliner}
The following code block can be copied to the terminal to install everything\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt update \&\& \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install -\/y build-\/essential cmake libuv1-\/dev libssl-\/dev \&\& \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/Determinant/salticidae.git \&\& \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd salticidae/ \&\& \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake . \&\& \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{make \&\& \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make install}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_build}{}\doxysubsection{Building}\label{index_build}
The project uses make to be built and the following make commands are available\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item make -- Build the project.
\item make debug -- Build the project with debugging symbols and the D\+E\+B\+UG flag defined (Useful for {\ttfamily \#ifdef D\+E\+B\+UG ... \#endif}).
\item make clean -- Remove temporary build files.
\item make run -- Clears the terminal and executes the project via ./main.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_debug}{}\doxysubsection{Debugging}\label{index_debug}
The project was made in the Visual Studio Code I\+DE and the necessary settings are made to enable debugging integrated into V\+S\+Code (via F5 key). Other dependencies (for V\+S\+Code development) are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools}{\texttt{ C/\+C++ extension}}
\item gdb (sudo apt install -\/y gdb)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_documentation}{}\doxysubsection{Documentation}\label{index_documentation}
The project\textquotesingle{}s documentation is made using \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html}{\texttt{ Doxygen}} and can be generated by installing Doxygen\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install -\/y doxygen graphviz}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Then building the documentation in the root of the project\textquotesingle{}s server folder using\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{doxygen Doxygen}
\end{DoxyCode}
